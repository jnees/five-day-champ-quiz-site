# FiveDayChamp - Portfolio Project

FiveDayChamp is a webapp/trivia training game that was born out of my family's love of trivia and the show Jeopardy! It is designed to help you practice for the Jeopardy online test by answering real questions that the show has asked over the years. I've always been disappointed by the quality of Jeopardy videogames. They make you type in the answer quickly on an awkward videogame keypad or select from multiple choice. Neither of these feels much like the true Jeopardy experience to me.

Since FiveDayChamp is a trainer and not a competitive game, there is no need to keep score and no need for clunky answer checking. It works more like flashcards. If you got the answer to the question right, you click the correct button. That's it!

You can select a difficulty level, ranging from Wolf Blitzer (Very Easy) to Ken Jennings (Very Hard). You can also narrow the questions down with certain keywords that you want to focus on. "I'll take 'Foods that start with the letter Q' for $1000". The game keeps track of your accuracy, which you can see in your reports.

It should be noted that this is in no way a commercial product, but it is live [here](http://quiz-prep-site.herokuapp.com/login) on a heroku if you would like to try it out! (It's on the free tier... so you may need to give it a moment to wake up.)

The webapp uses Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Heroku, and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
